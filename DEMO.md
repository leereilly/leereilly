# Git Hook Laugh Track System - Demo

This repository now includes a working Git hook system that adds humor to your development workflow!

## What just happened?

When you make commits, the system:
1. Detects your operating system
2. Attempts to play audio laugh tracks
3. Falls back to visual feedback if audio isn't available
4. Randomly selects different messages/sounds

## Quick Demo

Try these commands to see it in action:

```bash
# Install the system (if not already done)
./git-hooks/install.sh

# Test the system
./git-hooks/test.sh

# Make a commit to see it work
echo "Test change" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "Testing laugh track system"
# You should see/hear the laugh track!
```

## How it works

The system is completely non-blocking and won't interfere with your Git workflow. It just adds a moment of joy after successful commits! ðŸŽ­âœ¨
