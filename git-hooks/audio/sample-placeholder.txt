# Sample Audio Placeholder
# 
# This is a placeholder file to demonstrate the audio system.
# In a real setup, you would place actual audio files here:
# - sitcom-laugh-1.wav
# - applause-short.mp3
# - chuckle.wav
# 
# The system supports WAV, MP3, OGG, and M4A formats.
# For now, it will fall back to online audio sources.
